# Performance: systemctl Tuning & Caching

## 1. systemctl Tuning

### What is `systemctl`?

`systemctl` is a command used to manage **systemd**, which is the init system and service manager for Linux distributions. **systemd** is responsible for starting and managing system services (daemons), handling system boot processes, and more.

### Tuning `systemd` Services for Performance

1. **Understanding `systemd` Units**:
   - A **unit** is a configuration file that describes a system service or resource.
   - Types of units:
     - **Service** units (`*.service`): Define services that are run on startup or manually.
     - **Socket** units (`*.socket`): Manage network sockets.
     - **Target** units (`*.target`): Represent groups of services to be started together.
   
2. **Tuning Services**:
   You can optimize your system by disabling or modifying system services that are unnecessary or resource-hungry.

   - **List all services**:
     ```bash
     systemctl list-units --type=service
     ```

   - **Disable unnecessary services** (e.g., Bluetooth if not used):
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl disable bluetooth.service
     ```

   - **Enable critical services**:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl enable apache2.service
     ```

   - **Check the status of a service**:
     ```bash
     systemctl status apache2.service
     ```

   - **Start/Stop services**:
     - Start a service:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl start nginx.service
       ```
     - Stop a service:
       ```bash
       sudo systemctl stop nginx.service
       ```

   - **Optimize boot services**:
     Services that are needed for booting the system (e.g., `network.target`, `multi-user.target`) should be optimized for performance. You can remove unnecessary services from starting automatically by using:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl disable <service-name>.service
     ```

3. **Performance Tweaks Using `systemd`**:
   - **Adjusting the CPU scheduling**:
     Modify `systemd` to use CPU-affinity for certain services. For example, limiting a service to use only specific CPUs (e.g., for CPU-intensive services).
   
     Add this to a service's override configuration:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl edit <service-name>
     ```
     Then add:
     ```ini
     [Service]
     CPUSchedulingPolicy=other
     ```

   - **Tuning memory limits**:
     For memory-intensive applications, you can limit the memory available to them.
     Example:
     ```ini
     [Service]
     MemoryLimit=512M
     ```

4. **Auto-tuning on Boot**:
   Modify `systemd` to allow certain services to only start when needed, instead of starting on boot.
   - Modify the `systemd` unit file:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl edit <service-name>
     ```
     Add or modify the following:
     ```ini
     [Service]
     Restart=on-failure
     ```

## 2. Caching

### What is Caching?

**Caching** is the process of storing data temporarily to reduce access times, improve speed, and reduce the load on underlying data sources. Itâ€™s used at various levels (e.g., application, database, filesystem) to enhance performance.

### Types of Caching

1. **Disk Caching**:
   - **Linux Page Cache**: Linux uses a **page cache** to store file data in memory. This speeds up read and write operations, as frequently accessed files are stored in RAM.
   - **How to monitor page cache**:
     ```bash
     free -m
     ```

2. **Web Caching**:
   - **Proxy caches**: Web proxies can cache web pages for faster access.
   - **Browser caching**: Modern web browsers cache images, scripts, and web pages to speed up load times on subsequent visits.
   - **Cache control headers**: Websites can control caching behavior using HTTP headers like `Cache-Control`.

3. **Application Caching**:
   - **Memory-based caches**: Tools like **Memcached** or **Redis** store data in memory to provide faster access.
   - **Common use cases**:
     - Caching API responses
     - Storing session data
     - Database query result caching

4. **Database Caching**:
   - **Database query caching**: Databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL have caching mechanisms to store query results.
     - MySQL:
       - Query cache (deprecated in MySQL 8.0)
       - InnoDB buffer pool caches data in memory.
     - PostgreSQL:
       - Shared buffers store cached data.

### Implementing System-Level Caching

1. **Optimize Linux Disk Cache**:
   You can control how the Linux page cache behaves using `vm` settings.

   Example: **Change the swappiness** (how often the system swaps memory pages to disk):
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl vm.swappiness=10
   ```
   This lowers the likelihood of the system swapping memory pages to disk.

2. **System Cache Management with `vmtouch`**:
   The `vmtouch` tool can be used to lock files into memory to prevent them from being swapped out.
   - Install it:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install vmtouch
     ```

   - Lock a file into memory:
     ```bash
     sudo vmtouch -t /path/to/file
     ```

3. **Web Caching with `nginx` or `Apache`**:
   - **nginx**:
     To cache static files using `nginx`:
     ```nginx
     location /static/ {
         expires 30d;
         add_header Cache-Control "public";
     }
     ```

   - **Apache**:
     Enable caching modules:
     ```bash
     sudo a2enmod cache
     sudo a2enmod cache_disk
     ```

     Add caching configuration in the `apache2.conf` or specific site configuration:
     ```apache
     CacheEnable disk /static/
     CacheHeader on
     ```

### Optimizing Application-Level Caching

1. **Redis Caching**:
   Redis is an in-memory key-value store, often used for caching.
   - Install Redis:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install redis-server
     ```

   - Basic Redis configuration in your application (e.g., Python, Node.js):
     ```python
     import redis
     r = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)
     r.set('mykey', 'Hello, World!')
     print(r.get('mykey'))
     ```

2. **Memcached**:
   - Memcached is another in-memory caching system.
   - Install Memcached:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install memcached
     ```

   - Example of using Memcached in a Python app:
     ```python
     import memcache
     mc = memcache.Client(['127.0.0.1:11211'], debug=0)
     mc.set("some_key", "some_value")
     print(mc.get("some_key"))
     ```

---

### File System Caching: Tune `sysctl` for I/O Performance

- **Increase file system cache size**:
   You can increase the **vm.dirty_ratio** setting to give the system more memory for file system cache.
   ```bash
   sudo sysctl -w vm.dirty_ratio=60
   ```

   This will allow up to 60% of the system's memory to be used for file system cache.

---

### Monitoring and Testing Cache Performance

1. **Check cache usage**:
   Use `free` and `vmstat` to monitor system cache.
   ```bash
   free -h
   vmstat -s
   ```

2. **Test Cache Hit Rate**:
   Measure the cache hit rate in your application (especially for databases and caching systems like Redis). Low cache hit rates can indicate that your cache size or strategy needs adjustment.

---

### Conclusion

- **`systemctl` Tuning**: Optimize system services by managing the units, enabling only necessary services, and fine-tuning parameters like CPU and memory usage.
- **Caching**: Improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in memory (file system cache, web, application, and database caching). Tools like Redis, Memcached, and `nginx` caching help reduce latency and server load.
